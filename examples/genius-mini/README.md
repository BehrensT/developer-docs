# Introduction

Examples of how to implement [Genius Mini](https://cayan.com/genius/mini) for both the Android and iOS platforms.

# iOS (iPhone, iPad)

Genius Mini for iOS is [available from the Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-mini/id1228442028?mt=8). Genius Mini is implemented as a standalone application, where your POS interacts with the app using URL schemes. Please visit Apple's site for more details about [URL schemes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Introduction/Introduction.html) or [inter-app communication](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html) on iOS.

[Genius Mini iOS documentation](https://cayan.com/developers/knowledge-base/documents-samples/cayan-genius-mini-ios-documentation) is available on our developers site.

# Android

Genius Mini for Android is available from the Google Play Store.  Genius Mini is implemented as a standalone application, where your POS interacts with the app using either:

* The [traditional HTTP/HTTPS interface](https://cayan.com/developers/genius), identical to the API that Genius Countertop supports 
* OR as an [Android Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html) based API, similar to Apple's URL schemes, that provides a clean inter-app communication interface.

Developers are free to implement either API.
